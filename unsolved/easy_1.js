// Easy:
// 1. Write a method that returns an array of every number from 1 to 100. 

// 2. Write a method that returns an array of every other number from 1 to 100. (That is, 1, 3, 5, 7 … 99).

// 3. Write a method that returns an array of all numbers from 1 to 1000 that are divisible by 3.

// 4. Write a method that accepts one argument - an array of numbers - and returns an array of all numbers from that original array that are greater than 7. For example, if the input is [5, 8, 1, 7, 9, 10], the function should return [8, 9, 10].

// 5. Write a method that accepts an array of numbers as a parameter, and returns the number of how many 55’s there are in the array. For example, if the input is [55, 4, 7, 55, 9, 1, 55, 2, 3, 55, 0], the output should be 4. NOTE: DO NOT USE RUBY’s built-in “count” method.

// 6. Write a method that accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. For example, if the input is [1, 5, 7, 9, 2, 0], the output should be 24. Don’t use any of the built in “sum” methods that Ruby comes with.

// 7. Create a function that filters out negative numbers
// In this challenge, you’ll have a function that takes an array as an input and returns an array. But if all goes according to plan, it’ll remove the negative numbers. This is another example of a task that’ll be useful when combing through data and looking for clever ways to eliminate “bad data.”

// 8. Remove the spaces found in a string
// Yet another way to clean up data is to remove any errors or unnecessary spaces. This function will take in a string and then return it with all spaces removed. Think about if you were tasked with cleaning up customer data at your job. You could scale this function to clean up specific fields of data, such as zip codes.

// 9. Return a Boolean if a number is divisible by 10
// Here, you’ll create a function that’ll give you a “true” or “false” Boolean as its output. The inputted number should only return a “true” if it’s divisible by 10. Otherwise, your program should return a “false” answer.

// 10. Return the number of vowels in a string
// Create a function that’ll return an integer of the number of vowels found in a string. This is a great way to practice determining the features of a dataset. If you use JavaScript later in your career, you’ll be well-prepared to determine what datasets (or just strings) consist of. If you feel like an extra challenge, consider returning the number of characters.
